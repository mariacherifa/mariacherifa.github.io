I am a research and teaching assistant at [the Mathematics Department of Université Paris-Saclay in Orsay](https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/fr/). I hold a Ph.D. from [Institut Polytechnique de Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr), jointly carried out at [ENSAE-CREST](https://crest.science) and the [Criteo AI Lab](https://ailab.criteo.com), under the supervision of [Vianney Perchet](https://vianney.ai) and [Clément Calauzènes](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lFsKnyUAAAAJ&hl=en). My research focuses on online matching in bipartite graphs and, more broadly, on online allocation problems. Before my Ph.D., I graduated from the [master MVA (ENS Paris Saclay)](https://www.master-mva.com) in 2021, with a specialization in machine learning.
